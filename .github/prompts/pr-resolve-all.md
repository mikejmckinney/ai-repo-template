# PR Issue Resolution — Systematic Verify-and-Fix

> **Usage**: Post one of these as a PR comment:
>   - `@claude follow .github/prompts/pr-resolve-all.md`
>   - `@copilot follow .github/prompts/pr-resolve-all.md`
>
> Both agents will read this file and execute the Phase 1–4 procedure below.
> Claude is wired via `.github/workflows/claude.yml`'s `claude-mention` job.
> Copilot follows the `@copilot follow <path>` rule documented in
> `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
>
> **Phase 4** (auto-resolve bot-authored review threads) runs by default
> on every invocation of this prompt. The per-thread gate (allow-listed
> bot author + Phase 2 status `✅ Fixed` + verification green + thread
> not already resolved) is the only safety mechanism — there is no
> opt-in label. On the Copilot path, the GraphQL mutations may return
> `FORBIDDEN` because the Copilot cloud agent token lacks
> `pull-requests:write` in this repo; in that case, the relay-fallback
> job in `.github/workflows/agent-relay-reviews.yml` re-fires the
> mutations under `CLAUDE_PAT` after parsing the `⚠️ Errored` rows from
> the Phase 4 report table. See ADR-008 for the design.

You are resolving every open issue, suggestion, and TODO in this pull request. Your job is to find them all, verify each one, fix the valid ones, and produce a traceable audit trail. Do not guess — verify everything against the actual code.

> **How to run this prompt**: Read this entire file before starting. Execute
> Phase 1, then Phase 2. Execute Phase 4 **before** posting the Phase 3
> Resolution Report so Phase 3 can include the Phase 4 results. Do not
> interleave or skip phases. If your cumulative response would exceed
> GitHub's per-comment size limit, post sequential `Part 1/N`,
> `Part 2/N`, … comments rather than truncating. Apply the Rules section to
> every phase.

## Phase 1: Build the Issue/Suggestion Index

Scan ALL of these sources for issues, suggestions, requested changes, and TODOs:

1. **PR description** — look for task lists, noted limitations, known issues, "TODO" or "FIXME" mentions.
2. **Review threads** — every unresolved review comment, including inline code comments and top-level review bodies. Pay attention to threads marked "Request changes."
3. **Commit messages** — scan for "TODO", "FIXME", "HACK", "WIP", or "known issue" language.
4. **Code diff** — scan the changed files for new `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, `XXX`, or `WORKAROUND` comments introduced in this PR.
5. **Linked issues** — if the PR description references GitHub issues (#NNN), read those issues for acceptance criteria that may not be fully met.
6. **CI/workflow failures** — if any checks failed, treat each distinct failure as an indexed item.

**For each item found, assign a sequential ID** (e.g., `ISS-01`, `ISS-02`, ...).

**Always post the index as a standalone PR comment before starting fixes**, regardless of item count. This comment must precede any fix commits and must be distinct from the Phase 3 Resolution Report. **If the PR has more than 10 items**, additionally proceed in batches of 5 to prevent token exhaustion and let the author course-correct early.

**If an item was already addressed** in a subsequent commit or resolved thread: mark it `✅ Already resolved` with a link to the resolving commit, and skip to the next item.

### Index Output Format

Post this as a PR comment before starting fixes:

```markdown
## Issue/Suggestion Index

| ID | Source | Summary | Status |
|----|--------|---------|--------|
| ISS-01 | [Review comment](link) | Missing null check on `user` param | 🔍 Pending |
| ISS-02 | [PR description](link) | TODO: add rate limiting | 🔍 Pending |
| ISS-03 | [Code comment](link) | FIXME in src/auth.ts:42 | 🔍 Pending |
| ISS-04 | [CI failure](link) | TypeScript build error | 🔍 Pending |
| ISS-05 | [Review comment](link) | Suggestion: extract helper fn | ✅ Already resolved in abc1234 |

**Total**: X items found, Y already resolved, Z to address.
Proceeding with fixes for remaining items.
```

## Phase 2: Verify, Fix, Validate Each Item

For each unresolved item, work through this sequence. Do not skip steps.

### Step 1 — Link
Provide a direct URL to where the issue was mentioned (review comment permalink, PR description section, file + line in the diff, or issue number).

### Step 2 — Verify
Confirm the issue actually exists in the current state of the branch. This means:
- For bugs/logic issues: read the relevant code and confirm the problem. If possible, describe a concrete scenario that would trigger it.
- For missing tests: confirm the behavior is untested by searching the test files.
- For style/refactor suggestions: confirm the code matches what the reviewer described.
- For CI failures: read the failure log and identify the root cause.
- If the issue is **not reproducible** (already fixed, reviewer was mistaken, or the code has changed): document why and mark it accordingly. Do not fabricate a fix for a non-issue.

### Step 3 — Fix
If the issue is valid, implement the fix:
- Make the smallest change that addresses the issue.
- Stay inside the files already touched by this PR when possible. If a fix requires changes to files outside the PR's scope, flag it and ask before proceeding.
- For refactor suggestions: apply only if the suggestion is clearly better. If it's a judgment call, implement it but note that the author may want to review.
- Include the exact file path and line numbers in your report.

### Step 4 — Validate
After each fix (or batch of fixes):
- Run the test suite. Report pass/fail counts.
- Run the linter. Report clean/error counts.
- Run the build/typecheck. Report success/failure.
- If the repo has an `AI_REPO_GUIDE.md`, use its commands as canonical. Otherwise, detect from `package.json`, `Makefile`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.
- If a verification command is not available or not applicable, say so explicitly rather than skipping silently.

### Step 5 — Status
Assign one of:
- `✅ Fixed` — issue was valid, fix implemented, verification passed.
- `✅ Already resolved` — issue was already addressed before this run.
- `⚠️ Needs clarification` — issue is ambiguous, or the right fix depends on a design decision the author should make. Describe what's unclear and suggest options.
- `⚠️ Partial fix` — fix addresses part of the issue but something remains. Explain what's left.
- `❌ Not reproducible` — the issue does not exist in the current code. Explain why.
- `❌ Out of scope` — fix requires changes to files/systems outside this PR. Describe what's needed so the author can file a follow-up.

## Phase 3: Resolution Report

After all items are processed, post a final summary comment:

```markdown
## Resolution Report

### Summary
- **Total items found**: X
- **Already resolved**: X
- **Fixed in this pass**: X
- **Needs clarification**: X
- **Not reproducible**: X
- **Out of scope**: X

### Verification
- Tests: ✅ X passed, ❌ X failed
- Lint: ✅ Clean / ❌ X errors
- Build: ✅ Success / ❌ Failed
- Typecheck: ✅ Clean / ❌ X errors

### Detail

---

#### ISS-01: Missing null check on `user` param
- **Source**: [Review comment](link)
- **Evidence**: `src/auth.ts:42` — `user` parameter is used without a null guard. If the session lookup returns null (expired session, deleted user), this throws an unhandled TypeError.
- **Fix**: Added null check with early return of 401 at `src/auth.ts:42-45`. Commit: `abc1234`.
- **Verification**: `npm test` — 47 passed, 0 failed. New test added in `tests/auth.test.ts:89`.
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

---

#### ISS-02: TODO: add rate limiting
- **Source**: [PR description](link)
- **Evidence**: Confirmed — no rate limiting exists on the `/api/login` endpoint. The TODO in the PR description is a known deferred item.
- **Fix**: N/A — this is a follow-up item, not a bug in the current diff.
- **Verification**: N/A
- **Status**: ❌ Out of scope — recommend filing as a separate issue.

## Phase 4: Resolve bot-authored review threads

Phase 4 runs on every invocation of this prompt — Claude via `.github/workflows/agent-fix-reviews.yml`, Copilot via `@copilot follow` comments posted by `.github/workflows/agent-relay-reviews.yml` or by a human, and any agent invoked through a direct `@claude follow` / `@copilot follow` mention. If you are running this prompt, the gate below applies to you.

Resolve review threads whose backing item cleared Phase 2 with status `✅ Fixed` and whose top-level review comment was authored by an allow-listed bot. The point is to trim noise from CI-only reviewers after the fix has landed — never to silence a human. The per-thread gate below is the only safety mechanism.

### Allow-list (bot reviewers only)

**Normalization rule:** GitHub's REST and GraphQL APIs disagree on bot login formatting — REST returns `gemini-code-assist[bot]`, while GraphQL often returns the same identity as `gemini-code-assist` (no `[bot]` suffix). Before comparing, **strip any trailing `[bot]` from the login** and then compare case-insensitively against the normalized allow-list below. This is the canonical matching rule for Phase 4; apply it whichever API (REST or GraphQL) you sourced the login from. (`.github/workflows/agent-relay-reviews.yml` has separate bot-detection logic that matches on either a `[bot]` suffix **or** a literal allow-regex rather than stripping and normalizing — do not rely on that workflow's matcher as a reference for Phase 4.)

Normalized allow-list (match with `[bot]` stripped and compared case-insensitively):

- `gemini-code-assist`
- `copilot-pull-request-reviewer`
- `copilot` (the Copilot SWE agent; REST returns `Copilot`, GraphQL returns `copilot`)
- `chatgpt-codex-connector`
- `codex` (the shorter form Codex sometimes emits)
- `claude` — **only when the thread's root comment was authored directly by the `claude[bot]` / `claude` identity** (e.g., Claude's auto-review workflow posted the review). If a human opened the thread and `claude[bot]` merely replied (for example because the human wrote `@claude fix this` mid-thread), the root author is the human and Phase 4 must leave the thread open. The per-thread gate below already enforces "root author is allow-listed" — this bullet is a reminder that the root-author test is what keeps human-initiated dialogues from being silenced.

Worked example: a GraphQL-returned author `gemini-code-assist` → strip `[bot]` (no-op) → lowercase → matches `gemini-code-assist` ✅. A REST-returned author `gemini-code-assist[bot]` → strip `[bot]` → `gemini-code-assist` → lowercase → matches ✅.

Threads opened by any other login — including humans, unknown bots, and GitHub Actions user accounts — **must be left open**, even if the corresponding Phase 2 item was fixed.

### Per-thread gate

Resolve a thread only when **all** of the following hold:

1. The thread's root comment was authored by an allow-listed bot.
2. The Phase 2 status for the matching `ISS-NN` item is `✅ Fixed` (never `⚠️`, `❌`, `Already resolved`, or `Needs clarification`).
3. Phase 2 verification passed — tests, lint, build, and typecheck were all green for the batch that contained the fix.
4. The thread is not already resolved (`isResolved == false`).

Note: do **not** skip threads solely because they are `isOutdated`. Phase 4 runs **after** the fix commit is pushed, and a thread's commented line is frequently moved or replaced by that commit, which flips `isOutdated` to `true`. Condition 2 (Phase 2 marked the item `✅ Fixed`) is what guarantees the concern was actually addressed; `isOutdated` is just a side-effect of the fix and is not a blocker. `agent-auto-merge.yml` blocks on `isResolved == false` without considering `isOutdated`, so leaving outdated-but-fixed bot threads unresolved would defeat the entire purpose of Phase 4.

If any condition fails, skip the thread and record why in the Phase 4 log. Do not attempt to resolve threads you did not fix in this run.

### Resolve procedure

For each eligible thread:

1. **Fetch the thread node ID** via the GraphQL `pullRequest.reviewThreads` query. The REST review-comments endpoint does not return the node ID required by `resolveReviewThread`, so GraphQL is mandatory here. Example:

   ```graphql
   query($owner:String!, $repo:String!, $num:Int!) {
     repository(owner:$owner, name:$repo) {
       pullRequest(number:$num) {
         reviewThreads(first:100) {
           nodes {
             id
             isResolved
             isOutdated
             comments(first:1) {
               nodes { author { login } path line databaseId }
             }
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Paginate if the PR has more than 100 threads.

2. **Post an audit-trail reply** on the thread before resolving, so the resolution is traceable without digging through workflow logs. Use `addPullRequestReviewThreadReply` (GraphQL) or the REST `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{num}/comments/{comment_id}/replies` endpoint. Reply body format:

   ```
   Resolved by <agent> in <SHORT_SHA> (ISS-NN).
   If this wasn't addressed correctly, re-open the thread.
   ```

   Substitute:
   - `<agent>` — the agent that ran this procedure. **Always backtick-wrap any literal `@`-handle** in the reply body (write `` `@copilot` ``, `` `@claude` ``, `` `@copilot follow ...` `` — not the raw `@copilot` / `@claude` strings). An un-escaped handle in a thread reply is parsed by GitHub as a real mention and re-triggers the bot (Copilot cloud agent on `@copilot`; `.github/workflows/claude.yml`'s `claude-mention` job on `@claude`), which then re-fixes everything you just fixed and posts duplicate Resolution Reports. The top-level trigger comment (`@copilot follow ...` / `@claude follow ...`) stays un-backticked — that's the intended dispatch; the audit reply must not re-dispatch. Use `claude (agent-fix-reviews)` when invoked by `.github/workflows/agent-fix-reviews.yml`, `copilot (via agent-relay-reviews)` when invoked by an `` `@copilot follow` `` comment from `.github/workflows/agent-relay-reviews.yml`, `` claude (`@claude` mention) `` / `` copilot (`@copilot` mention) `` when invoked by a direct human mention, or your own agent name if invoked by other tooling.
   - `<SHORT_SHA>` — the resolving commit SHA (first 7 chars).
   - `ISS-NN` — the ID from your Phase 1 index.

   If you know your fix-cycle number (e.g. the Claude path exposes cycle `N/3`), append `, cycle N/3` after the `ISS-NN` for additional traceability. Omit it if unknown.

3. **Fire the `resolveReviewThread` mutation** with the thread node ID:

   ```graphql
   mutation($id:ID!) {
     resolveReviewThread(input:{threadId:$id}) { thread { id isResolved } }
   }
   ```

   Confirm `isResolved: true` in the response. If the mutation fails, leave the thread open and log the error — do not retry silently.

### Phase 4 report

Because Phase 4 runs **before** Phase 3 posts the Resolution Report (see "How to run this prompt" at the top of this file), include the following section within the Phase 3 Resolution Report itself, listing every thread considered. Do not post Phase 4 as a separate comment. The `Thread ID` column is **required** — it is the GraphQL node ID (`PRRT_…`) that the relay-fallback job in `agent-relay-reviews.yml` parses to retry mutations on the Copilot path; omitting it breaks the fallback.

```markdown
### Phase 4 — Thread auto-resolution

| Thread | Thread ID | ISS | Author | Action | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-----|--------|--------|-------|
| [link](#) | PRRT_kwDOExampleA | ISS-01 | gemini-code-assist[bot] | ✅ Resolved | Fixed in abc1234 |
| [link](#) | PRRT_kwDOExampleB | ISS-02 | copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot] | ⚠️ Errored | addPullRequestReviewThreadReply returned FORBIDDEN |
| [link](#) | PRRT_kwDOExampleC | ISS-03 | human-reviewer | ⏭️ Skipped | Human-authored — left open |
| [link](#) | PRRT_kwDOExampleD | ISS-04 | gemini-code-assist[bot] | ⏭️ Skipped | Phase 2 status was "Needs clarification" |
```

Use `⚠️ Errored` when the per-thread gate passed but the GraphQL mutation failed (e.g. `FORBIDDEN`). On the Copilot path, the relay-fallback job will pick up `⚠️ Errored` rows by Thread ID, post the audit reply under `CLAUDE_PAT`, and fire `resolveReviewThread`. Use `⏭️ Skipped` only when the per-thread gate failed (human author, status not `✅ Fixed`, etc.) — that signals the fallback to leave the thread alone.

### Safety rules

- **Never resolve a human-authored thread**, even if you fixed what they asked for. Humans expect to click Resolve themselves.
- **Never resolve a thread whose Phase 2 item is not `✅ Fixed`.** "Not reproducible" and "Out of scope" still warrant human acknowledgement.
- **Never resolve a thread without first posting the audit reply.** The reply is the paper trail; resolution without it leaves reviewers guessing.
- **Never include a live `@`-handle in the audit reply body.** Backtick-wrap every `@copilot` / `@claude` / `@copilot follow ...` / `@claude follow ...` reference in the reply so GitHub treats it as code, not a mention. An un-wrapped handle re-dispatches the bot (Copilot cloud agent + `.github/workflows/claude.yml`'s `claude-mention` job both listen for raw `@`-strings anywhere in a PR comment or review reply body) and produces duplicate fix runs. The **top-level trigger comment** that invoked `pr-resolve-all.md` in the first place stays un-backticked — that one is supposed to dispatch.
- **Do not resolve threads from a previous fix cycle.** Scope Phase 4 to items fixed in the current run only — the `ISS-NN` IDs from this run's Phase 1 index are your scope.

## Rules

- **Do not fabricate issues.** Only index things that are explicitly mentioned in the sources listed in Phase 1, or concrete problems you can verify in the code.
- **Do not make drive-by changes.** Fix only what's indexed. If you notice something else while working, note it at the bottom of the report under "Additional Observations" but do not fix it without asking.
- **Do not mark something fixed without verification.** Every `✅ Fixed` must have a passing test/lint/build result.
- **Preserve existing behavior.** Fixes should not change functionality beyond what's needed to resolve the indexed issue.
- **If you run out of context or token budget**: Post what you have so far with a clear "Batch 1 of N complete — proceeding with next batch" marker. Do not silently truncate.
- **If `AI_REPO_GUIDE.md` exists**, read it first for canonical test/lint/build commands and repo conventions.
